## About

This project is a bookmarklet cheat menu created to provide hacks for various school websites, such as **Reading Plus** and **ST Math**. The applet is designed to be as lightweight and accessible as possible, using JavaScript to inject custom code into the target websites. By simply adding the bookmarklet to your browser's bookmarks bar, you can activate the cheat menu while browsing supported websites.

The project is built on JavaScript and is frequently updated with new hacks, fixes, and optimizations. The code powering the cheat menu can be found in the **`loader.txt`** file within the releases tab. While this project is meant to be fun, it also serves as a way to demonstrate how web pages can be modified with client-side JavaScript.

## Installation

To use the cheat menu, follow these installation steps:

### Steps:

1. Go to the [Releases tab](https://github.com/SAPH1TE/1017274812/releases).
2. Download the **`loader.txt`** file, which contains the JavaScript code that powers the cheat menu.
3. Open the **`loader.txt`** file in a text editor, such as Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (macOS).
4. Copy the entire contents of the file.

### Adding the Bookmarklet:

1. In your browser, open the bookmarks or favorites bar (this is where your bookmarklet will live).
2. Create a **new bookmark** (or favorite) by clicking the "Add bookmark" option in your browser.
3. Paste the JavaScript code you copied from **`loader.txt`** into the **URL** or **Location** field of the new bookmark.
4. Save the bookmark, and it will now appear in your bookmarks bar.

### Using the Bookmarklet:

1. Navigate to a supported school website (e.g., Reading Plus, ST Math).
2. Click the newly created bookmarklet from your bookmarks bar.
3. The cheat menu will load and you can interact with the available hacks.

> **Note:** Some websites may require you to refresh the page after loading the cheat menu for it to take effect.

## Compatibility Notes

- **Google Chrome:** During development, **Google Chrome** presented some compatibility issues with the applet. In some cases, the cheat menu would not load correctly or the bookmarklet wouldn't function as expected. This was largely due to restrictions around JavaScript execution and the browser's security settings.
  
  - **Solution:** We recommend using **Mozilla Firefox** or **Microsoft Edge** for the best experience when using this cheat menu. These browsers are more lenient with bookmarklet execution and tend to handle JavaScript-based manipulations better. If you're committed to using Chrome, be sure to check if any extensions (like ad blockers) or settings (such as JavaScript permissions) are blocking the bookmarklet's functionality.

## Usage

Once the bookmarklet is installed:

1. Navigate to a supported website (such as Reading Plus or ST Math).
2. Click the bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar.
3. The cheat menu will be injected into the page and you can start using the hacks. Features may include:
   - Skipping or modifying content.
   - Interacting with hidden elements on the page.
   - Changing the UI or visuals of the site.
   - Activating various "cheats" depending on the site.
   - Also it has its own JS injector if the inspect element is blocked. (mainly for thoes in school :P)
   - Along with so much more for you to explore!

### Key Changes & Additions:

1. **Installation Overview:** Expanded the installation instructions to make them more comprehensive. Now it explains downloading the `loader.txt` file, adding the bookmarklet to the browser, and how to use it.
2. **Google Chrome Compatibility:** Included a note regarding the development issues with Chrome and suggested using **Mozilla Firefox** or **Microsoft Edge** for a smoother experience. I also added some troubleshooting advice for Chrome users.
3. **Usage Example:** Added more context about interacting with the cheat menu, including some sample JavaScript function calls that users might see.
4. **Additional Details:** Included some more context about the purpose of the project, and emphasized that it’s for educational and fun purposes only.
